    <h2>Comets</h2>
    <p><i>Comets</i> are small, icy objects that have very elliptical orbits around the Sun. Their orbits carry them from the outer solar system to the inner solar system, close to the Sun.<br> Early in Earth's history, comets may have brought water and other substances to earth during collisions. Comets tails form as the comet flies close to the Sun and the outer layers of ice melt and form a glowing coma. Particles streaming from the Sun push this gas and dust into a long tail. The tail always points away from the Sun. The coma is bright because it reflects light from the sun. Comets appear for only a short time when they are near the Sun. They seem to disappear as they move bact to the outer solar system</p>

    <h3>The Kuiper belt</h3>
    <p><i>Kuiper Belt<i> is a disc of celestial objects beyond Neptune that contains asteroids, comets, dwarf planets, and Centaurs among others. The Kuiper Belt spans from 30 AU to 50 AU. Beyond the orbit of the last planet of the solar system, Neptune, is a comet disc that is billions of miles in lenght. This disc is far away from the home to extremly cold worlds. Similar to the Asteroid Belt, but many times larger, this asteroid family boasts the likes of comets, asteroids, minor planets, dwarf planets and centaurs, among others. This trans neptunian doughnut-shaped ring of ice-coldncelestial objects is called the Kuiper Belt, and is home to more than one <i>trillion</i> comets! </p>
