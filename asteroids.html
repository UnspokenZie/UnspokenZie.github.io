    <h2>Asteroids</h2>
    <p>Asteroids are rocky objects that orbit the sun, and although the vast majority of asteroids are harmless,there are often close shaves with our planet.The term asteroid covers a very broad range of solar system objects, including debris lefts behind by objects that did not successfully grow into planets.It is also called a "Minor Planet" or a body with more rock than ice,ranging from less than a km to about 1000km in size, numbering in the many thousands, and orbiting the sun from inside the earth's orbit to beyonds Saturn's</p>

    <h3>The Asteroid belt</h3>
    <p>The asteroid belt is a region of space between the orbits of mars and jupiter where most of the asteroids in our Solar System are found orbiting the Sun.The asteroid belt probably contains millions of asteroids. Astronomers think tht the asteroid belt is made up of material that was never able to form into a planet, or of the remains which broke apart a very long time ago. The asteroid belt in a variety of sizes. Some are very smal(less than a mile across), while others are quite large. The largest asteroid is called ceres.It is about one-quarter the size of our moon.
